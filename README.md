This ML project aims to solve the growing crime across Indian cities, by developing a ML prediction model which will help an individual knowing when 
and where a crime is likeley to be happened so people can stay aware while
travelling to diffrent places in India. It will not that be accurate with time but instead with a time range of months based on previous commited crime in the city.

The future aim for the modification is to integrate with Google maps which will help people to stay alert and also to avoid places with high
crime rates and most likelyhood for occurence of crime.

the model is trained on 
Algorithm :- Random Forest
Dataset :- crime_data_india (kaggke)

current features
1. crime hotspots:- cities with the highest record of crime
2. Map visualization :- the cities with their crime record is visible on Indian Map.
